I am currently working as an applications programmer with Professor Trey Ideker at UC San Diego School of Medicine. I received my Bachelor’s degree in Bioinformatics from UC San Diego in 2018. During my undergraduate studies, I was a research assistant in [Ideker Lab](http://idekerlab.ucsd.edu/) and a lab technician in [Computational Neurobiology Lab](https://cnl.salk.edu/) at Salk Institute.

My research interests lie in the intersection of data science and healthcare. I am interested in developing machine learning methods to answer questions on genomics, population health and clinical decision making.
