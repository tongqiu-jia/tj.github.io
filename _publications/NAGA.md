 ## Abstract
 We present an accessible, fast, and customizable network propagation system for pathway boostingand interpretation of genome-wide association studies. This system—NAGA (Network AssistedGenomic Association)—taps the NDEx biological network resource to gain access to thousands ofprotein networks and select those most relevant and performative for a specific association study.The method works efficiently, completing genome-wide analysis in under 5 minutes on a modernlaptop computer. We show that NAGA recovers many known disease genes from analysis of schizo-phrenia genetic data, and it substantially boosts associations with previously unappreciated genessuch as amyloid beta precursor. On this and seven other gene-disease association tasks, NAGA out-performs conventional approaches in recovery of known disease genes and replicability of results.Protein interactions associated with disease are visualized and annotated in Cytoscape, which, in addi-tion to standard programmatic interfaces, allows for downstream analysis.
